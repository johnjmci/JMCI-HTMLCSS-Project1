        <h1>The Coffee Guy & Bakery Gal</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The Coffee Guy and Bakery Gal are couple, Artur and Charlotte. The pair created CGBGs in 2018 after working seperately in the coffee and bakery industries for ten years previously.</p> 
            <br>
        <p>Ethan has worked as a barista in independent cafes in London, Paris, and Amsterdam. He holds several official qualifications endorsed by the Speciality Coffee Association and the coffee experience at CGBGs is the culmination of his professional experience and take on the art of coffee.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Charlotte oversees the bakery at CGBGs. She brings experience of working as a pastry chef and baker at restaurants and bakeries in Bristol and London.  Prior to creating CGBGs, Charlotte ran an online bakery business and still accepts comissions for celebrations cakes via the shop.</p>
